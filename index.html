</picture><p>The Hidden, Lost &amp; Forgotten Gems of SC </p><p>With SC there are a few moments that as a backer, new players will have missed and it’s those experiences I want to shed light onto in this post. These moments are unique and usually removed as a new update passes. Sure they’re bugs and glitches but there's
    a certain romance and sense of discovery that is felt when you happen upon them.</p><p>So lets begin.</p><p>The first time I experienced this was when CIG released patch 2.0. We were given AC, containing the environments Dying Star &amp; Broken Moon. Within the dying star map there is a space station with the sole purpose of being an obstacle and “Lookin Cool”.
    With a little bit of exploration backers found interesting nooks and crannys that the developers and artists never expected us to see. Realising character models were clipping through walls and seeing the underbelly of SC’s design, CIG’s team took
    it upon themselves to step up the texturing and modeling to include internals of not only environments and ships alike. The exquisite consequence of this was the inevitable depth we now see today. I’m sure CIG will have wall clipping as an issue for
    a long time to come but with this added effort into designing objects from the inside out, secrets often revile themselves to the most detail oriented of player.</p><p>Not long after discovering the playfulness of this discovery did backers start testing the boundaries of what SC could deliver. From Glitching into the dying stars depths to stealing a Vanduul ship in AC. The amount of content that fulfilled the playful
    desire of the budding Sc community was starting to bloom. This stream of content only built upon itself and truly started to define how the community was going to play SC.</p><p>Missiles: Missiles went through so many variations that when there was a final design, backers realized that strength in a foundation was the most important. Missile launch - flies to target - contact and explosion. One thing you won’t see anymore is
    Missile cam. A beautiful chase cam that followed the missile to it’s inevitable demise.</p><p>Archaeology: There was an explorer sale that got the community hyped up, which led to an interesting couple events. From seeing design in asteroids to attempting to lad on a planet only to find a bug that lets you let the planetoid envelop your ship.</p><p>Another thing that few may remember was in the early years of SC there was not max viewing distance or LOD, meaning you could see enemies at a further distance and at a much higher level of detail. Early videos show this and shows how scalability was
    built into a near perfect prototype, and perhaps one day we’ll be able to go back to that perfect LOD as PC’s get better.</p><p>As we got access to the PTU the amount of hidden gems increased ten fold.</p><p>There was a team of players that managed to get trapped in quanum travel and actually managed to get their friends to jump to them in sustain quantum travel themselves and attempt a boarding. This Star Trek: Into Darkness; Warp Attack scene on steroids.
    This was actually brought up as a possible game feature but I haven’t heard anything since.</p><p>We had a few corporations work out formation flying. clever ways to exploit racing and compete in Races around Yella’s asteroid ring. Speaking of Yella when they implementer early NPC pirate spawning, sometimes there would literally be a swarm of 50+
    ships spawning all around you and it would end up being a spectacular turkey shoot. I think I saw so many explosions I was starting to worry the game would crash from maxing out particle effects.</p><p>there was a great patch that had sheild disabling weapons that were fitted on the Avenger. What a gong show and what a sad thing as it’s not as evident now. Even the warlock EMP is hardly used now. But the incredible emergent gameplay that these indirect
    weapons create.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="33"><!-- react-empty: 34 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-f2a4f2e9-b555-4c46-a45b-98817b110877" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="35"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="36"><p>Beginners guide to Star Citizen</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e3d40f7e-f79f-44ab-9f98-975da227e7b9.png" alt="Industrial Hanger and and Avenger."><p>You’ve heard people say this before; <em>Don’t purchase SC unless you can handle game crashes and incomplete features that are subject to change.</em></p><p>With the release of patch 2.5 and wrapping up Gamescon with an amazing gameplay presentation, SC is shaping up to be close to what was envisioned for the PU(persistant universe). New players are looking to get involved in SC but don’t know where to start.</p><p>This guide provides a solution and my recommended progression through the game and it’s many menus and flight modes.</p><p>Something I’ll never take for granted is the development of specific features within the game that are later removed because they are deemed bugs.(but for a moment in time they are your play thing. I for one loved missile cam and the ICC probe waypoint
    flicker bugs. My hope was that they would persist within the game but we’re removed due to majority community vote. This is why I play games before they launch. For little gems. Perhaps you’ll find things to love about SC I have yet to know about.</p><p>Where to start:</p><ol>
    <li>Make sure you meet the minimum PC requirements for the game.</li>
    <li>Create an account on the <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/" title="RSI">RSI Website </a>and use my referral Code STAR-N2JV-9M9S.(Helps me out as a promoter of the game and I might get cool things for my hanger! :D)</li>
    <li>Purchase a game package. Make sure the following words are included in the package details:
        <ul>
            <li>Star Citizen Digital Download</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Download the game. On a side note once I got SC on an SSD lode times were halved.</li>
</ol><p>From here you should have the game ready to launch, and your adventure awaits. Don’t worry about control scheme at this time just enjoy all that SC has to offer and deal with that later. I worried about the type of control scheme early on and it was a
    mistake because they change controller set up throughout development so practising could prove fruitless. But, we could get into a whole discussion about that later.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="37"><!-- react-empty: 38 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="39"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="41"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="42"><span data-reactid="43"><!-- react-empty: 44 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="45"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="46">Sherpain</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="49"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
