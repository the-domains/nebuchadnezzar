You've heard people say this before; _Don't purchase SC unless you can handle game crashes and incomplete features that are subject to change._

With the release of patch 2.5 and wrapping up Gamescon with an amazing gameplay presentation, SC is shaping up to be close to what was envisioned for the PU(persistant universe). New players are looking to get involved in SC but don't know where to start.

This guide provides a solution and my recommended progression through the game and it's many menus and flight modes.

Something I'll never take for granted is the development of specific features within the game that are later removed because they are deemed bugs.(but for a moment in time they are your play thing. I for one loved missile cam and the ICC probe waypoint flicker bugs. My hope was that they would persist within the game but we're removed due to majority community vote. This is why I play games before they launch. For little gems. Perhaps you'll find things to love about SC I have yet to know about.

Where to start:

1. Make sure you meet the minimum PC requirements for the game.
2. Create an account on the [RSI Website ][0]and use my referral Code STAR-N2JV-9M9S.(Helps me out as a promoter of the game and I might get cool things for my hanger! :D)
3. Purchase a game package. Make sure the following words are included in the package details:
  * Star Citizen Digital Download
4. Download the game. On a side note once I got SC on an SSD lode times were halved.

From here you should have the game ready to launch, and your adventure awaits. Don't worry about control scheme at this time just enjoy all that SC has to offer and deal with that later. I worried about the type of control scheme early on and it was a mistake because they change controller set up throughout development so practising could prove fruitless. But, we could get into a whole discussion about that later.
