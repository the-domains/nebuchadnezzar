# The hype paradox

Ever since its conception sc had infatuated me, from its weekly community updates to the extensive lore. Even the controversy has pulled at my emotional strings in so many ways. when fanboys talk of their devotion to the game I think it goes deeper than just waiting and then wanting to play SC.

What initially got me hooked was the incredible promis of great spaceship combat. From fast paced pew pew 227-badger repeaters to the epic bloom sepation of rattler 2 missiles. They nailed the combat. Sure there were set backs and flaws in the design but we were consistently communicated to about how CIG was going to iron out the details. I don't think I could have communicated any better and that's what surprised me. I was being shown something that I didn't have any idea how to do. It was as if they truly respected the backers. It wasn't CR's exsahustive thank yous or Sandy and Ben's game appriciation of community content although I'll admit it was nice to hear. But listening to backers and their feedback and acting on it.
